		<h3 class="no-margin-left">Avoiding Commissions</h3>
		<p>You are strictly prohibited from attempting to negotiate the fee for a project with another member directly (outside of Kazilynk) during an ongoing project. Both the service provider and service seeker are responsible for notifying Kazilynk if the payment amount increases (above the agreed upon amount) after the job has been rewarded. Receiving a larger amount than the original project bid, without notifying us, will be considered an attempt to avoid the commissions. If at the time of a withdrawal request the bidder has failed to notify Kazilynk of a payment received above the amount of his bid, Kazilynk reserves the right to deduct double the fee for the amount that should have been reported. We believe our commissions are very fair and justified for the service we provide, therefore we will absolutely not tolerate any of this activity on Kazilynk.</p>
