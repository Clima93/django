		<h2 class="bold">PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		
		<h4>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h4>
		<p>Kazilynk collects personal information about you (the “User”) and distributes that information to connect you with employers and/or workers who can provide services to you. We know you care about the collection, use and disclose of your personal information, and we have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy.</p>
		<p>The following discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices for www.kazilynk.com  and our application for mobile devices (the “Application”). By using the Site or the Application (collectively, the “Services”), you do hereby warrant and represent that you have read, understand, and accept without limitation or qualification all terms and conditions stated herein. To make this privacy policy easy to find, we make it available from all pages of our Site. </p>

		<h4>APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
		<p>This privacy policy applies to all information we collect through our Site and Application from Users, including you. This policy also applies to our treatment of any information that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners. This policy does apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party companies, websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Services or to individuals that Kazilynk does not manage or employ. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those Third Party Services so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
		<p>As used in this Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates internationally.</p>

		<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RETAIN</h4>
		<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>

		<h4>A. Registration</h4>
		<p>During the User registration process, you must provide us the following information: your name, mobile phone number, location and password. You should choose a password that is known only by you. Without this minimal amount of information, you cannot create a Kazilynk account. By creating a Kazilynk account, you acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and you allow others, including Kazilynk, to identify you. You also allow Kazilynk to use your information in accordance with our Terms of Use.</p>

		<h4>B. Worker Application</h4>
		<p>All Users are allowed to use Kazilynk to find and hire qualified people to provide services for you. However, in order to be hired for a job through Kazilynk (to become a “Worker”), you must apply and be approved by Kazilynk. We are committed to providing a safe, secure, and all around great service for our Users. Therefore, before approving Workers, we may require additional information including but not limited to: skills, professional experiences, educational background, job references, Kenya Police Certificate of Good Conduct, National Identity Card number, work licenses, and other information. We may also obtain information about Workers from third parties such as identity verification services.</p>

		<h4>C. Customer Support</h4>
		<p>We may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here, including but not limited to information related to your contact with our customer support team or your responses to surveys. This information helps Kazilynk accurately respond to customer inquiries and provide you with exceptional service.</p>

		<h4>E. Cookies</h4>
		<p>When you access our Site, small data files called “cookies” may be sent to and saved by your web browser. Your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can view your cookies through your browser settings. Kazilynk only uses secure cookies, which means they have been encrypted by our authentication system. We, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may use these cookies to recognize your web browser and to learn how and when you use the Services.</p>
		<p>Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or allow you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Kazilynk relies on cookies to preserve the Kazilynk identity you have created while logged on. If you choose to disable cookies, you will not be able to sign into your account on the Site. You will still be able to use all features of the mobile phone application. Nonetheless, we do not recommend disabling your cookies while using the Services.</p>
		<p>Some third-party services that we may use, such as Google Analytics, may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>

		<h4>F. IP Addresses</h4>
		<p>Under certain circumstances, such as when you log into the Services or load a web page from the Services, we may collect and store your Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address"). We generally use IP Address information to help diagnose problems with our server, to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services.</p>

		<h4>G. Information from Children</h4>
		<p>We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from any individuals under the age of 15.</p>

		<h4>H. Data Retention</h4>
		<p>Kazilynk maintains the right to retain your information for an indefinite period of time, if we so wish. However, we may respond to written User requests to nullify account information. If you wish to make such a request, which requires that we verify your identity, or if you have any questions regarding this policy, contact us at admin@kazilynk.com. By using these Services, you hereby represent and warrant that you understand and agree that all information submitted by you to Kazilynk becomes the property of Kazilynk and may be used in the sole discretion of Kazilynk in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. If you wish to close your account, you may do so by contacting us at info@kazilynk.com</p>

		<h4>LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND SERVICES</h4>
		<p>Our Services may occasionally contain links to other third-party websites and online services. If you choose to visit another website or online service by clicking on a link, you will be directed to that third party’s website or online service. The fact that we may link to a website or online service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites and online services, and these third parties may place their own cookies or other files on your computer and collect data or solicit Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information from you. Other sites and online services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites or online services you visit before providing any information or using such websites or services.</p>

		<h4>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
		<p>Kazilynk is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Services.</p>
		<p>Your Kazilynk account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. This password is encrypted and only you and authorized Kazilynk employees have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, select and protect your password appropriately. You should limit access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing the Site, particularly if you are using a shared computer. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to unauthorized parties. You should also limit access to your mobile phone to protect the security of Services provided through the Application.</p>
		<p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive text messages and other communications from us. Please note that we will never ask you for your password or other Account information; if you receive such a notification, please forward it us or contact our customer support team.</p>
		<p>Despite Kazilynk’s efforts to ensure that your information is secure on its system, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of User information at any time. If you have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Service page. Kazilynk expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any individuals obtain the information you submit to the Services.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>To provide the services and customer support you request</li>
